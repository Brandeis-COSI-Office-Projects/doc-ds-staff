# Documentation for Staff with No Prior Programming Knowledge

## What is this repository

This is the Alumni Data Analytics Project Documentation repository for **staff or faculty** with no prior programming knowledge and are not interested in knowing the implementation detail of the project.

The Alumni Data Analytics Project is collecting past Computer Science alumni employment information and analyzing the data to better advise current students. We have collected over a thousand undergraduate alumni information and are currently developing a way to visualize the data.

## How to contribute to this documentation

This documentation is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Hugo is a really fast static site generator built by Go. You will need prior Hugo and Markdown knowledge to proceed.

### Hugo

The [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) is pretty useful for learning hugo. You don't need to know all the details. Just basic hugo commands, file directory, and how to write new pages.

I also recommend watching [Mike Danne's Youtube video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOnyRlyS-liKL5ReHDcj4G3).

This project uses [Hugo Book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme to render the documentation.

After learning a bit of Hugo, you can start to contribute to this documentation. Simply `git clone` the repository to your local computer and start writing/modifying. **Do not touch the `.github` directory!**

### Markdown

All the files are written in Markdown. I suggest taking look at [the Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) if you don't have prior Markdown knowledge.
