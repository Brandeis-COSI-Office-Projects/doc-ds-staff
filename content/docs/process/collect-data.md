# Collect Data from LinkedIn

## First Search

We will first collect alumni information from LinkedIn and copy from their public profile.

## Second Search

If the alumni information doesn't exist on LinkedIn, we will move to Google, Facebook, University Faculty Profile, etc to see if there is one. If the alumnus is not able to find after the two searches, they will be marked `"Not Found"` for further searches. Alumni we did find will be marked `"First Pass"`.
