# How to Keep this Project Going

## Kickstart for Future Office Assistants

If hiring more office assistants to take this project, please advise them to read the [Documentation for Office Assistants](https://brandeis-cosi-office-projects.github.io/doc-ds-oa/). **(It's a MUST!)**

The Documentation for OAs contains a detailed explanation of what the whole project is, the exact format to collect alumni data, how the code works, how the directory is structured, how to proceed with new data, how to handle bugs, etc. *Without reading the documentation, the bugs-fixing process might take so much longer.*

If they have any questions about the project, they can always reach out to me. It's also noted in their documentation.

## How to Store Data

Originally, we were collecting data in Google Sheet. It's fine to keep the raw, unprocessed data in the Google Sheet, but the office assistants will need to download it as a `csv` file to run the code. 

I have created a [separate repository](https://github.com/Brandeis-COSI-Office-Projects/ds-raw-data) solely for storing the csv data. When kickstarting the project, the OAs can just download the `data` folder from that repository. It is also noted in their documentation.

## When a New Generation Graduates

This project might restart every year when a new generation of students graduates. After listing all the new grads' names, the office assistants must follow exactly the way that their documentation states to collect the data in order to ensure faster processing and cleaning. So, the most important prerequisite of the project is to read the whole documentation.  

In the OA's documentation, I have provided an easy way to deal with the new data. They can always change/modify the code to fit their/the department's needs.
