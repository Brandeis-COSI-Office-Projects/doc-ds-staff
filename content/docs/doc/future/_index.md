# How to Keep this Project Going

## Kickstart for Future Office Assistants

If hiring more office assistants to take this project, please advise them to read the [Documentation for Office Assistants](https://brandeis-cosi-office-projects.github.io/doc-ds-oa/). **(It's a MUST!)**

The Documentation for OAs contains a detailed explanation of what the whole project is, the exact format to collect alumni data, how the code works, how the directory is structured, how to proceed with new data, how to handle bugs, etc. *Without reading the documentation, the bugs-fixing process might take much more time.*

## How to Store Data

Originally, we were collecting data in Google Sheet. It's fine to keep the raw, unprocessed data in the Google Sheet, but the office assistants will need to download it as a `csv` file to run the code. 

I have created a separate repository solely for storing the csv data.
