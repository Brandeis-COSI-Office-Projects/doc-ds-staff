# Introduction

Hi! I'm [Tianqi Zhao](https://tianqizhao.com). I'm one of the developers/office assistants of the Alumni Data Analytics Project. 

The Alumni Data Analytics Project is collecting past Computer Science alumni employment information and analyzing the data to better advise current students. We have collected over a thousand undergraduate alumni information and are currently developing a way to visualize the data.

This project is advised by [Justin Penney](mailto:jpenney@brandeis.edu), the Department Coordinator. The team includes [Cindy Hou](mailto:cindyhou0210@brandeis.edu) and me.

In order to help staff and faculty who don't have prior programming experience and don't need to know all sorts of details behind the project, I wrote this documentation to briefly explain what the entire project is, what we have done, and how to keep this project going.

If you have any questions after reading this documentation, feel free to reach out to me by email: louiszhao0517@gmail.com and cc to tz2529@columbia.edu

Alright, *let's get started!*

<!-- ## Suis quot vota

Ea _furtique_ risere fratres edidit terrae magis. Colla tam mihi tenebat:
miseram excita suadent es pecudes iam. Concilio _quam_ velatus posset ait quod
nunc! Fragosis suae dextra geruntur functus vulgata.
